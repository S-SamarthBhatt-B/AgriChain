## 🔗 Project Workflow  

AgriChain ensures **end-to-end traceability and transparency** in the agricultural supply chain.  

1. **Farmer Stage**  
   - Farmer registers crops on the platform.  
   - Uploads details like crop type, harvest date, certifications.  
   - A unique entry is recorded on the blockchain.  

2. **Distributor Stage**  
   - Collects produce from farmers.  
   - Updates storage, transport, and quality details.  
   - Blockchain records logistics data to avoid tampering.  

3. **Retailer Stage**  
   - Retailers receive verified produce from distributors.  
   - Products are assigned **QR codes** linked to blockchain entries.  
   - Ensures only authentic goods reach consumers.  

4. **Consumer Stage**  
   - Consumers scan the **QR code** on purchased items.  
   - Instantly view product origin, journey, pricing, and certifications.  
   - Builds trust by verifying authenticity before purchase.
